## Description
Our teamâ€™s project is called furniture ordering system. It required an admin or a customer to login first before entering the system. The admin has a fixed username and password. While a customer that do not have login username and password can do so by clicking the register button on the menu header.

The system provide basic process an ordering system needs. For example, admin can view the list of all registered customer and orders. Admin can also add, search, update and delete product from the database. Customer on the other hand can update their details or profile and buy a product. The bought product will be inserted in the order tables so that the admin can view their orders.
